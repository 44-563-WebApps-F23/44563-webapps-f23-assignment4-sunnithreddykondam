<h5>MRS. ELVSTED.</h5>

<p>[After a pause, suddenly sits up in her chair, and listens eagerly. Then
    she sinks back again wearily, moaning to herself.] 
</p>
<p>Not yet!--Oh God--oh God--not yet!</p>  
<br>
<p>BERTA slips cautiously in by the hall door.  She has a letter in
    her hand.</p> 
<br>
<h5>MRS. ELVSTED.</h5> 

<p>[Turns and whispers eagerly.] </p>
<p>Well--has any one come?</p>  
<br>
<h5>BERTA.</h5>

<p>[Softly.] </p>
<p>Yes, a girl has just brought this letter.</p>
<br>
<h5>MRS. ELVSTED.</h5>

<p>[Quickly, holding out her hand.]</p> 
<p>A letter! Give it to me!</p>   
<br>
<h5>BERTA.</h5>

<p>No, it's for Dr. Tesman, ma'am.</p>
<br>
<h5>MRS. ELVSTED.</h5>

<p>Oh, indeed.</p>
<br>
<h5>BERTA.</h5>

<p>It was Miss Tesman's servant that brought it. I'll lay it here on the
    table.</p>
