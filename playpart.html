<h3>Hedda Gabler Act 3 by Isben</h3>

<p>MRS. ELVSTED.</p>

<p>[After a pause, suddenly sits up in her chair, and listens eagerly. Then
    she sinks back again wearily, moaning to herself.] Not yet!--Oh God--oh
    God--not yet!</p>  
<br>
<p>BERTA slips cautiously in by the hall door.  She has a letter in
    her hand.</p> 
<br>
<p>MRS. ELVSTED.</p> 

<p>[Turns and whispers eagerly.] Well--has any one come?</p>  
<br>
<p>BERTA.</p>

<p>[Softly.] Yes, a girl has just brought this letter.</p>
<br>
<p>MRS. ELVSTED.</p>

<p>[Quickly, holding out her hand.] A letter! Give it to me!</p>   
<br>
<p>BERTA.</p>

<p>No, it's for Dr. Tesman, ma'am.</p>
<br>
<p>MRS. ELVSTED.</p>

<p>Oh, indeed.</p>
<br>
<p>BERTA.</p>

<p>It was Miss Tesman's servant that brought it. I'll lay it here on the
    table.</p>
